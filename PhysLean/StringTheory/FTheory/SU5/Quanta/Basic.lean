# Quanta of representations

In SU(5) × U(1) F-theory theory, each 5-bar and 10d representation
carries with it the quantum numbers of their U(1) charges and their fluxes.

In this module we define the data structure for these quanta and
properties thereof.

/-- The quanta associated with the representations in a `SU(5) x U(1)` F-theory.
  This contains the value of the charges and the flux intergers `(M, N)` for the
  5-bar matter content and the 10d matter content, and the charges of the `Hd` and
  `Hu` particles (there values of `(M,N)` are not included as they are
  forced to be `(0, 1)` and `(0, -1)` respectively. -/

## Anomaly cancellation conditions

There are two anomaly cancellation conditions in the SU(5)×U(1) model which involve the
`U(1)` charges. These are

- `∑ᵢ qᵢ Nᵢ + ∑ₐ qₐ Nₐ = 0` where the first sum is over all 5-bar represenations and the second
  is over all 10d representations.
- `∑ᵢ qᵢ² Nᵢ + 3 * ∑ₐ qₐ² Nₐ = 0` where the first sum is over all 5-bar represenations and the
  second is over all 10d representations.

According to arXiv:1401.5084 it is unclear whether this second condition should necessarily be
imposed.

def HdAnomalyCoefficent (qHd : Option ℤ) : ℤ × ℤ :=

  | none => (0, 0)

def HuAnomalyCoefficent (qHu : Option ℤ) : ℤ × ℤ :=
  match qHu with
  | none => (0, 0)
  | some qHu => (-qHu, -qHu ^ 2)

/-- The anomaly cancellation conditions on quanta making up the fields present in
  the theory. This corresponds to the conditions that:

- `∑ᵢ qᵢ Nᵢ + ∑ₐ qₐ Nₐ = 0` where the first sum is over all 5-bar represenations and the second
  is over all 10d representations.
- `∑ᵢ qᵢ² Nᵢ + 3 * ∑ₐ qₐ² Nₐ = 0` where the first sum is over all 5-bar represenations and the
  second is over all 10d representations.
