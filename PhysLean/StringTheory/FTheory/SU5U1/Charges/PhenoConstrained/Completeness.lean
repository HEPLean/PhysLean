# Complete of `nonPhenoConstrainedCharges I`

We show that the `nonPhenoConstrainedCharges I` is complete, that is,
it contains every charge in `ofFinset I.allowedBarFiveCharges I.allowedTenCharges`
which is not pheno-constrained, permits a top yukawa and is complete.

## Method

The method of our proof is the following.

1. We define `completionTopYukawa` which contains all `completions` of elements
  `irreducibleElems I topYukawa` which are not pheno-constrained. We show
  that every charge in `ofFinset I.allowedBarFiveCharges I.allowedTenCharges`
  which is not pheno-constrained and complete must contain an element
  of `completionTopYukawaSame` as a subset.
2. We show that `completionTopYukawa I` is a subset of `nonPhenoConstrainedCharges I`.
3. We then use the fact that one can not add to any charge in `nonPhenoConstrainedCharges`
  another `Q5` or `Q10` without remaining in `nonPhenoConstrainedCharges` or allowing
  a pheno-constraining term to be present.

This proof of completeness is more like a certification of completeness, rather
than a constructive proof.

## Key results

- `not_isPhenoConstrained_iff_mem_nonPhenoConstrainedCharge` which specifies
  the completeness of the tree of charges `nonPhenoConstrainedCharges I`.
