# Dimensions and unit

A unit in physics arises from choice of something in physics which is non-canonical.
An example is the choice of translationally-invariant metric on the time manifold `TimeMan`.

A dimension is a property of a quantity related to how it changes with respect to a
change in the unit.

The fundamental choices one has in physics are related to:
- Time
- Length
- Mass
- Charge
- Temperature

(In fact temperature is not really a fundamental choice, however we leave this as a `TODO`.)

From these fundamental choices one can construct all other units and dimensions.

## Implementation details

Units within PhysLean are implemented with the following convention:
- The fundamental units, and the choices they correspond to, are defined within the
  appropriate physics directory, in particular:
  - `PhysLean/SpaceAndTime/Time/TimeUnit.lean`
  - `PhysLean/SpaceAndTime/Space/LengthUnit.lean`
  - `PhysLean/ClassicalMechanics/Mass/MassUnit.lean`
  - `PhysLean/Electromagnetism/Charge/ChargeUnit.lean`
  - `PhysLean/Thermodynamics/Temperature/TemperatureUnit.lean`
- In this `Units` directory, we define the necessary structures and properties
  to work derived units and dimensions.

## Dimensionalful

Given a type `M` with a dimension `d`, a dimensionalful quantity is a
map from `UnitChoices` to `M`, which scales with the choice of unit according to `d`.

## Measured quantities

We defined `Measured d M` to be a type of measured quantity of type `M` and of dimension `d`,
the terms of `Measured d M` are corresponds to values of the quantity in a given but arbitary
set of units.

If `M` has the type of a vector space, then the type `Measured d M` inherits this structure.

Likewise if `M` has the type of an inner product space, then the type `Measured d M`
inherits this structure. However, note that the inner product space does not explicit track
the dimension, mapping down to `‚Ñù`. This is in theory fine, as it is still dimensionful, in the
sense that it scales with the choice of unit.
