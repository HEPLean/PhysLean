# The tight binding chain

The tight binding chain corresponds to an electron in motion
in a 1d solid with the assumption the electron can sit only on the atoms of the solid.

The solid is assumed to consist of `N` sites with a seperation of `a` between them.

Mathematically, the tight binding chain corresponds to a
QM problem located on a lattice with only self and nearest neighbour integractions.
